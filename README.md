# AlmostABlog

A simple project to test some theories about Dependency Inversion, Unit Test and Hexagonal Architecture.

# The Plan

The plan is develop a blog like application running in two parts: An API and a Front End.

The API will be developed with .NET Core 2.2.

The Front End, at first, will be made with Angular7

# The API

I've started the API creating a dotnet project called AlmostAnAPI with the command
`dotnet new webapi -o AlmostAnAPI`
